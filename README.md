doaj_export
===========
This plugin is actually made of three different plugins working together:  
* «Bibliographic Metabox» creates a metabox in the post editing page that allows the journal editor to insert metadata that will be used later in the exporting file  
* «Citation in meta tag» adds meta tag in the html page using the metadata already inserted by the preceding plugin. These meta tags are used by Google Scholar or Mendeley [Mendeley - Informations for Publishers] (http://www.mendeley.com/import/information-for-publishers/)  
* «DOAJ-XML-Export» creates an XML file based on DOAJ XML Schema with the metadata requested by DOAJ database
